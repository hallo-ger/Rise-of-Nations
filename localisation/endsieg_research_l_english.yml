    ### MODERN DAY DOCTRINES
    
    #Land Doctrines
 TITLE_LEGACY_DOCTRINES:0 "Legacy Doctrines"
 LEGACY_DOCTRINES_TITLE:0 "Legacy Doctrines are Cold War-era doctrines that still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought."
 legacy_doctrines_MD:0 "Legacy Doctrines"
 legacy_doctrines_MD_desc:0 "Legacy Doctrines are Cold War-era doctrines that still have a noticeable influence on modern military thought. Though doctrines change over time, the past is still deeply embeded in any armed force."
 modern_blitzkrieg_MD:0 "Modern Blitzkrieg"
 modern_blitzkrieg_MD_desc:0 "Incredibly successful in the opening stages of World War 2, Germany's Blitzkrieg Doctrine was widely copied by others, becoming a mainstay of Cold War strategic thought - especially in NATO circles. It aims to concentrate mobile forces, using them to continuously maneuver into enemy territory whilst avoiding enemy strong points."
 forward_defense_MD:0 "Forward Defense"
 forward_defense_MD_desc:0 "NATO strategists, in countering the threat of Soviet armor overrunning Western Europe, came up with the doctrine of Forward Defense. Pre-planned defensive forces armed with anti-tank and anti-air weapons would starve off the initial push while reserves would be mobilized behind them. The idea was that the initial titanic-sized battles would determine the outcome of the war, and thus the majority of active forces should be placed as close to the front as possible."
 encourage_nco_iniative_MD:0 "Encourage NCO Initiative"
 encourage_nco_iniative_MD_desc:0 "Western military thought encouraged initiative among non-commissioned officers (lower-level command), viewing them as the backbone of their armies. With rapidly changing situations, avoiding having to go through the entire chain of command allows an NCO to exploit opportunities on the battlefield that would otherwise be missed."
 air_land_battle_MD:0 "AirLand Battle"
 air_land_battle_MD_desc:0 "AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, with air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding the enemy front line, taking pressure off the enemy’s main advance. The aim is to delay the enemy, creating a window of opportunity to defeat front line forces while delivering severe attrition to their rear."
 grand_battleplan_MD:0 "Grand Battleplan"
 grand_battleplan_MD_desc:0 "The Grand Battleplan doctrine favors the pre-planning of each stage of combat extensively, holding the view that the side with the best planning would prevail. When done correctly, it can be very powerful, as troops can concentrate on perfecting their aspect of the plan, while allowing combined operations in forces incapable of real-time coordination. While good planning avoids logistical problems, it is slow work, redicing initiative and having no real flexibility in the face of a fluid front line."
 rigid_hierarchy_MD:0 "Rigid Hierarchy"
 rigid_hierarchy_MD_desc:0 "With the legitimate fear that one’s own army poses the greatest threat to regime survival, commanding positions would often be done out of political loyality instead of competance. Large, live-fire excersises would generally not be held. Furthermore, desicion-making would be centralized, making it slow and inflexible in the face of evolving threats."
 praetorian_guard_MD:0 "Praetorian Guard"
 praetorian_guard_MD_desc:0 "With the political leadership focusing the army on regime protection, elite seperate units were set up that employed professional soldiers with ideological selection and training. These would recieve the best weapons and training, making them well-placed to defend the political leadership from uprisings and the threat of coups by the normal conscripted army."
 armoured_mass_assault_MD:0 "Mass Armoured Assault"
 armoured_mass_assault_MD_desc:0 "Mass Armoured Assault, under the Soviet concept of "Deep Battle" stressed combined arms cooperation, offensive action, and heavily armored shock units. Multiple attacks would be made on a single front by slower, firepower-heavy units in order to break the enemy tactical zone. At the same time, highly mobile armored and mechanized forces would be held in reserve, advancing into the front once gaps are created. This is distinct from Blitzkreig, which focuses on single weak-points instead of multiple points of contact."
 deep_echelon_advance_MD:0 "Deep Echelon Advance"
 deep_echelon_advance_MD_desc:0 "With gaps in enemy lines sucessfully created, several advances of heavily armored shock troops would ravage the enemy rear at a high speed while avoiding strong points of enemy resistance - leaving them to follow the advances of less heavy infantry forces. The goal is to sieze enemy territory at an breakneck speed, creating the conditions whereby the enemy loses the will to mount an operational defence."
 army_group_operational_freedom_MD:0 "Army Group Operational Freedom"
 army_group_operational_freedom_MD_desc:0 "While rigid in tactical disposition, the Soviet doctrine allowed significant operational freedom to army group formations, enabling ground commanders to make quick desicions. This freedom was larger than among NATO forces at the time, but it did not extend down to lower officers and commanders."
 massed_artillery_MD:0 "Massed Artillery"
 massed_artillery_MD_desc:0 "Using large amounts of both regular artillery and rocket artillery concentrated at the frontline enemy, the hope was to break and disrupt their normal functions. Using artillery in such numbers also reduces the need for air support. The sheer numbers led many to call both the Russian and Soviet Armies as an "artillery army with tanks"."
 infiltration_assault_MD:0 "Infiltration Assault"
 infiltration_assault_MD_desc:0 "The Infiltration Assault doctrine uses night-time infiltration behind enemy strong points to allow suprise assults at normally well-defended positions to succeed by cutting them off from reinforcements."
 defence_in_depth_MD:0 "Defense in Depth"
 defence_in_depth_MD_desc:0 "Defense in Depth, often also called "elastic defense", is all about delaying instead of outright denying the advance of the enemy. Supply depots and pre-made fortifications should be placed far from the front, as should the majority of forces. By buying time and causing additional enemy casualties by yielding space, the enemy momentum will wear down from attrition."
 armoured_counterpunch_MD:0 "Armoured Counterpunch"
 armoured_counterpunch_MD_desc:0 "Building upon Defense in Depth, this strategy is about deploying significant armored forces at advantageous times in order to cut off deep echelon advances, achieving an decisive victory. However, such concentrations are vulnerable to enemy airpower."
 frontline_defence_MD:0 "Frontline Defense"
 frontline_defence_MD_desc:0 "Massing the majority of pre-planned defensive forces as close to the border as possible yields us the largest chance of maintaining territory, which is essential if we have a limited area to retreat to."
 early_Tunnel_Warfare_MD:0 "Early Tunnel Warfare"
 early_Tunnel_Warfare_MD_desc:0 "Building extensive networks of underground tunnels allows covert re-supply, shifting of forces and better defenses through ambush opportunities. It allows our forces to rest without being subject to enemy airpower."
 guerilla_specialisation_MD:0 "Guerilla Specialization"
 guerilla_specialisation_MD_desc:0 "Guerilla warfare seeks to disrupt the military superiority of the opponent by denying them direct combat except in the few areas where parity can be achieved through terrain advantages or ambushes. Also seeks to subject the enemy to constant attrition through attacks on softer targets, such as supply convoys."
 Century_Re_Evaluation_MD:0 "21st Century Re-Evaluation"
 Century_Re_Evaluation_MD_desc:0 "The end of the Cold War gave military planners around the world the nessesary breathing room to select new doctrines for the future."
 TITLE_NETWORK:0 "Network-Centric Warfare"
 NETWORK_CENTRIC_WARFARE_TITLE:0 "Network-centric warfare seeks to interlink all aspects of warfare with sophisticated computing networks to leverage informational superiority into full-spectrum dominance of warfare."																																																						 
 Network_Centric_Warfare_MD:0 "Network-Centric Warfare"
 Network_Centric_Warfare_MD_desc:0 "Network-Centric Warfare was pioneered by the US in the 90’s, based on introducing command and control and intelligent sensors at increasingly lower levels of the armed forces. This will enable enhanced situational awareness for desicion-makers and combat forces alike, as well as rapid target assessment using supercomputers, reducing planning times."
 TITLE_DECENTRALIZED:0 "Decentralized Warfare"
 DECENTRALIZED_WARFARE_TITLE:0 "By decentralizing command structures and expanding informational warfare into all aspects of society, one can deny the enemy situational awareness and gain local operational advantages."
 Decentralized_Warfare_MD:0 "Decentralized Warfare"
 Decentralized_Warfare_MD_desc:0 "Decentralized and asymmetric warfare has been pioneered by Iran and Russia. It assumes conflict against an networked and technological superior opponent can cripple the command and control structure. The answer has been to transform into smaller military units with independent desicion-making and command structures to remain combat effective. It also places great importance on warfare by alternative means and strong coordination with friendly locals to achieve an advantage in local information."
 TITLE_GUERILLA:0 "Guerilla Warfare"
 GUERILLA_WARFARE_TITLE:0 "By denying a superior enemy desisive battle and instead attacking their support structure, they will be forced to disperse into smaller units we can catch by surprise. Bluring the lines between combatant and civilian, we spread chaos and demoralize the enemy into admitting defeat."
 Guerilla_Warfare_MD:0 "Guerilla Warfare"
 Guerilla_Warfare_MD_desc:0 "Widely in usage by non-state actors, guerilla warfare seeks to disrupt the military superiority of the opponent by denying them direct combat except in the few areas where parity can be achieved through terrain or ambushes. Fighting towards a political end goal, non-military means such as psychological warfare are employed to wear down the opponent’s stability and will to fight. Ironically, through spreading chaos, we can build support for ourselves as the only stable alternative for society."
 Civilian_Infiltration_MD:0 "Civilian Infiltration"
 Civilian_Infiltration_MD_desc:0 "The core of any successful insurgency is to blend in with the general population, both as protection and as grounds for recruitment, so that any targeted surgical action against the insurgency is impossible."
 Drug_Manufacture_MD:0 "Drug Manufacturing"
 Drug_Manufacture_MD_desc:0 "Any insurgency needs funding, and by controlling the manufacturing and distribution of illicit drugs, a great deal of income can be gained."
 Ideological_Purity_MD:0 "Ideological Purity"
 Ideological_Purity_MD_desc:0 "By rejecting the possible revenue from drugs, moral superiority can be achieved against the opponent. The organization will also be protected from its goals being co-opted by greed, achieving a the ideological purity nessesary to prevail."
 Social_Services_MD:0 "Social Services"
 Social_Services_MD_desc:0 "Exploiting the lack of state-provided services or our own disruption of them, Social Services can be used to bind the population's loyalty towards us."
 Human_Shield_MD:0 "Human Shield"
 Human_Shield_MD_desc:0 "Having the loyality of locals, we can protect ourselves from massive bombing from the opponent by basing ourselves in the close proximity of civilians. If we are bombed anyway, civilian casualities can be employed as propaganda to reduce the opponent’s war support."
 Youth_Indoctination_MD:0 "Youth Indoctination"
 Youth_Indoctination_MD_desc:0 "By taking control over education, we can establish ideological indoctrinations of the youth to give us future soldiers willing to sacrifice everything for the cause."
 Hit_and_Run_Tactics_MD:0 "Hit and Run Tactics"
 Hit_and_Run_Tactics_MD_desc:0 "Offensive Hit and Run Tactics seek to force the opponent to disperse their forces geographically, making them easier targets for us. At the same time, sucessful operations will enhance our image while minimizing losses."
 Prison_Raids_MD:0 "Prison Raids"
