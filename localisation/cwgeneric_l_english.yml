## Events ##
 cwtree.1.t:0 "Red Friday"
 cwtree.1.d:0 "It was a rather normal day on the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], or at least for [Root.GetAdjective] circumstances. The [Root.GetCommunistParty] was experiencing a large growth in the past weeks, with strikes and brawls being a daily occurrence. Today, however, it came to a terrible incident.\n\nMultiple union leaders called up once again for a country-wide strike and several hundred, if not thousands, of workers, communists and the like marched through the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]. However, when they reached the traffic junction of the city, they were welcomed by a battalion of soldiers. When they were requested to stop and go back to their jobs, some followed the order however, the majority stayed and wanted to continue the strike and even some anarchists and radical socialists even threw stones at them. In reply, the commander in charge ordered his men to fire at the crowd.\n\nWhat followed was panic along with numerous brawls and gunfights, with some resisting late into the evening. In the following days, many left journals condemned this as an “Unjustified and coward attack on the workers and freedom-loving people of this nation.“ Long story short, we haven't really contributed to the stabilization of the situation."
 cwtree.1.a:0 "As if it wasn't bad enough already."
 cwtree.2.t:0 "Countrywide Acts of Sabotage"
 cwtree.2.desc:0 "It was a quiet and nice morning. [Root.GetLeader] just woke up and dressed for the coming day, as suddenly an explosion interrupted his daily routine. He rushed to a window and couldn't believe what his eyes saw: A giant smoke cloud rose into the sky at the industrial district of the capital. The explosion was soon followed by the sirens of the approaching firefighters, who try to save as much as possible. Moments later, reports reached [Root.GetLeader], telling about numerous bomb blasts on several factories across the entire nation."
 cwtree.2.a:0 "Great, my day is already ruined before it even started."
 cwtree.3.t:0 "The March on [From.Capital.GetName]"
 cwtree.3.d:0 "It was already evening when dozens or even hundreds of members of the [Root.GetCommunistParty] in the nation called up for a march on several government buildings.\n\nIt was obvious that their main target were not some town halls in the countryside, but [Root.Capital.GetName], where quickly a massive crowd of thousands of communists, socialists, unionists and workers formed and occupied several important buildings. Their main goal, however, was the seat of the [Root.GetAdjective] government itself, and so the crowd got moving, determined to overthrow the current and corrupt rule of [Root.GetLeader]. On their way, they encountered a few misguided loyalists, who still seemed to prefer their current government over our just and fair cause. Needless to say, they were quickly overwhelmed.\n\nWhen the crowd finally reached its destination, they were welcomed by a few desperated loyalists and hasty constructed defenses, with [Root.GetLeader] himself at the top. Because several of our attempts to solve the situation peacefully failed, fighting eventually started around midnight. The gunfights were heavy and desperate, but after an hour the last defenders outside the building were either captured or dead.\n\nInside, the remaining loyalists fiercely tried to stop us, with near to know prisoners being made. In the end, our brave revolutionaries finally came to [Root.GetLeader] and his ministers, with most of them being lynched by the furious attackers. When the next morning dawned, the old government was no more and the red flag proudly waved over [Root.GetCapital]."
 cwtree.3.a:0 "Time for some real changes."
 cwtree.4.t:0 "Unforseen Side Effects"
 cwtree.4.d:0 "Shocking news reached us today: Several anti-communist militaries have deserted or, even worse, are now open rebelling against our new regime. And if it wasn't already bad enough, many officials have stopped working and multiple high-ranking popular politicians are openly defaming us, stating that we are a “Corrupt, despotic and totalitarian regime, that violently overthrew our old government for the sake of their own lust for power, which they covered in the quest for equality.“\n\nWith having a large part of the military and the population against us, quick action is required or we will end like our old rulers."
